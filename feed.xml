But I can’t stress enough how important it is to do a bit of home work first – lenders can be particular about what unit or apartment you’re trying to buy. As experts in the Cairns market and first home owner lending, LendFirst can help you make the right selection up front. Here’s a few examples of what lenders will and won’t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;size-matters&quot;&gt;Size Matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The living area, not including any car spaces or balconies, must usually be at least 50m2. Some lenders will look at 40m2 at a push. The property also needs to have at least one separate fully enclosed bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;postcodes-and-deposits&quot;&gt;Postcodes and deposits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenders require bigger deposits in some areas, particularly capital cities. In the Cairns region, the postcodes affected are 4870 &amp;amp; 4879. Here you may need 10%-20% deposit if there are more than 10 units in the complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complex-complexes&quot;&gt;Complex Complexes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lenders will look at different types of complexes differently. Some of the different types are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional&lt;/strong&gt; - all units are occupied permanently by their owners or rented to long term tenants. These complexes are the most common and are widely accepted by lenders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resorts&lt;/strong&gt; - resort or holiday apartment complex units are harder to get a loan for. They are either not accepted at all, or you need 20%-30% deposit for the lender to even consider your loan – that can be as much as $45,000 on a property of $150,000. If there’s an onsite manager or office managing the complex, it’s likely to be a resort.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mix!&lt;/strong&gt; - some complexes are not quite resorts/holiday apartments but are also not quite traditional either. They allow a mix of both holiday letting and permanent owner occupiers and they may or may not have an onsite manager. These complexes are often acceptable if you can show that you will live in your property on a permanent basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-many-loans-with-one-lender&quot;&gt;Too many loans with one lender&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes lots of buyers in the same complex will get their loans from the same lender. The lenders don’t always like this, so will put a ceiling on how many loans they will do in each complex. This means that they may decline some new loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to check this until you make your application – but it doesn’t happen often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using LendFirst for your loan means that if this does happen, we simply talk to one of our other lenders and sort it out without hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-go-there&quot;&gt;Don’t go there!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some property types that lenders won’t consider at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studio Apartments&lt;/strong&gt; - no separate bedroom. The bedroom is in the same open space as the kitchen, lounge or dining area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Accommodation&lt;/strong&gt; - usually shared bathrooms and kitchens with individual rooms let&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Key&lt;/strong&gt; - one unit is divided into 2 using a lockable internal door. These are mostly found in resort/holiday apartments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel/Motel&lt;/strong&gt; - these are considered ‘serviced apartments’ and are usually unacceptable to lenders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Share&lt;/strong&gt; - where ownership is shared with other people and access is limited to a specific number of days or weeks each year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company title&lt;/strong&gt; - an older style where the block of units is owned by a company and ownership of ‘shares’ shows ownership of a particular unit. The main problem with these properties is that the consent of the other owners may be needed to sell, lease or mortgage your unit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As first home owner specialists, LendFirst are experts in helping with unit or apartment purchase. We’ll help you through the maze, make it simple and help you to make wise decisions when purchasing this kind of property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;Key Points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the size of the property before you go and fall in love with it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask questions about the other property owners and occupiers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to LendFirst to make sure you’re looking at the right property types&lt;/li&gt;

Take looking at someone else’s home. We know it’s probably not OK to grab a beer from the fridge, but what else should we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give yourself plenty of time.&lt;/strong&gt; Arriving at 1:59 when the open home finishes at 2 is not a great start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you park politely.&lt;/strong&gt; Parking in the driveway is a no-no until you own the home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test the drawers and cupboards—once not ten times.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t go through every drawer and cupboard either.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your shoes off.&lt;/strong&gt; Wear thongs that you can leave on the doorstep. People have probably had the floors cleaned for this inspection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring a tape measure.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll need one to check that your furniture, fridge and TV fit in the space you’re seeing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to the agent.&lt;/strong&gt; They are likely to remember the courteous people and can help you with this purchase—or notify you of others that come on the market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally—go to the loo before you inspect.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not, I repeat, do not, use the toilet. I can’t stress this enough!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows how difficult it can be for first home owners to save a deposit – and then there’s Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (find out more in my blog) to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is another way! A Family Guarantee is basically parents, or grandparents, guaranteeing that they will cover the bank’s losses should the buyer default on their loan. You may also hear ‘Parental Guarantee’, ‘Family Pledge’ or ‘Limited Guarantee’ all of which mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-they-guaranteeing&quot;&gt;What are they guaranteeing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person giving the guarantee is basically saying that, if the person buying their home defaults, then they promise to cover the debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You buy a house for $400,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You borrow from the bank $400,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family guarantee $80,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guarantee, usually ‘secured’ against the family member’s home, is 20% of the cost of the house, avoiding the need to pay Lender’s Mortgage Insurance, or save a deposit. So, the property ladder is no longer out of reach. The family member will be known as ‘the guarantor’. This a ‘limited’ guarantee – limited to $80,000 in the example above.  It’s important for the first-time buyer to make the loan repayments, as their parents would probably be pretty unhappy if they didn’t! For this reason, banks will still do a thorough check to make sure the borrower can afford the monthly payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-at-risk-for-the-guarantor&quot;&gt;What’s at risk for the guarantor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the borrower defaults, and the property has to be sold, then in our example, the bank can claim up to the $80,000 guarantee if they make a loss. The amounts would change for different purchase prices. Your broker will make sure you know what’s what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the bank doesn’t make a loss, and the property sells for a lot more, then the guarantee will not be used.  The worst-case scenario is the guarantors may have to sell their house they used as security for the guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guarantors also need to think about whether they will need to borrow any money themselves, as the banks will take this guarantee into account when assessing how much they can borrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guarantors should ALWAYS seek independent legal advice before entering into an arrangement like this. There may be a cost for this but it’s worth it in the long run. LendFirst will also talk to them in depth about their obligations and what it all means – we see it as a key part of looking after our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-is-the-guarantee&quot;&gt;How long is the guarantee?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guarantee is for the life of the loan, up to 30yrs. The bank can reassess the loan and release the guarantor if they are happy that they have enough security, for example, if property prices have gone up sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LendFirst Home Loans will always help you to structure your loan to ensure that the guarantor can be removed sooner rather than later.
Who can be a guarantor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most banks only allow parents to be guarantor but some allow siblings.  More distant relations cannot usually be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guarantors who are working, or can provide investment property to support the loan are usually accepted. Retired guarantors with little savings who would use their home as security for the pledge are usually not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-still-get-the-20k-first-home-owners-grant&quot;&gt;Can I still get the $20k First Home Owners Grant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes – but disclose on your application that you are receiving financial help from the guarantors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to LendFirst, and get your guarantor to talk to us too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you’re comfortable with the monthly repayments for the loan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the guarantor gets legal advice and understands exactly what they’re getting into&lt;/li&gt;

There are lots of benefits to owning your own home. Before you search for your perfect home it’s best to make sure you work out what you can afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re renting in Cairns, it’s likely that you’re paying on average around $350 per week. When you’re an owner your expenses change, so don’t just use your rental payment to work out how much you can borrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-should-check-first&quot;&gt;What you should check first&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure your credit rating is in order —  &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/am-i-credit-worthy-what-you-need-to-know/&quot;&gt;my earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; gives you some good hints and tips on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sort your budget before house-hunting — not the other way around. There are extra costs when you are a home owner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rates — Your expenses can change by around $50 per week as a property owner rather than tenant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Insurance — you’ll now need to insure the building, not just your contents, adding around $30 per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also need to make sure you can make your payments if interest rates rise. A rate increase of 2% adds $80 per week to loan repayments on a $280,000 loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your broker will work through your finances with you and help you to sort out exactly what you can afford to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also ask yourself a simple question: “If my rent increased by $150 per week, could I still afford to live where I am now?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only have to tweak your lifestyle a little — perhaps to stop eating out quite as much - then you’re probably on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d have to move to a cheaper rental to make the payments, then you may need to consider buying a home in a lower price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about costs that you will have as an owner that you don’t have as a tenant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider what you can afford now — and if interest rates go up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to your broker who will give you all the information and help you need to make the step to home ownership&lt;/li&gt;

You’ll only ever need to know what they mean when you’re going through the process. It can seem like the banks and solicitors have made up these words (and maybe they have) so let me make sense of one for you today – settlement date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it&quot;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply the official day that ownership of the home transfers to the person that’s buying it. You may also hear this described as the ‘title’ of the property being exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day when money and property title are exchanged between buyer and seller and ownership of the property officially transfers to the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;just-before-settlement&quot;&gt;Just before settlement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your broker and solicitor will keep in touch with you in the run up to your settlement date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will let you know if there’s anything you need to do. Usually this is making sure that your solicitor has your deposit on settlement day so that it can actually happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also go and have another look at the property before you settle. This is called a ‘pre-settlement inspection’. If you included anything in the contract that needed doing (known as a ‘special condition’), like repairing a broken fence, it’s recommended that you take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your solicitor will help you if you have any questions about what you should include as a special condition on the contract. You can find out more about contracts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qld.gov.au/law/housing-and-neighbours/buying-and-selling-a-property/buying-a-home/making-an-offer-on-a-home/contract-of-sale&quot;&gt;this helpful government website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-happens&quot;&gt;So what happens?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your solicitor, your bank, the seller’s solicitor and the sellers bank all get together, usually at seller’s bank or the seller’s solicitor office. You don’t need to be there – but have your phone handy in case they need to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after those weeks of planning and organising, the actual change of ownership only takes about 5 minutes! It’s amazing. More than 1.5 trillion loans are settled each year in Australia, so the process has been practised a few times and is really well organised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-is-settlement-day&quot;&gt;When is Settlement Day?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will have agreed settlement day as part of your contract, and each one is different. You can only change this if both you and the seller agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you miss the agreed settlement date you may be ‘in breach of contract’, meaning that you have not done what you said you would do. This can mean that the contract can be terminated completely by the seller and you may have to pay a substantial penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s best for buyers and sellers do everything they possibly can to make sure they hit that agreed settlement date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;after-settlement-day&quot;&gt;After Settlement Day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve taken out a home loan your broker will have given you all of the information about how it will work. Settlement day, as well as the day that the property becomes yours, is also the day that your home loan officially starts. Your lender will confirm your payment to you, and interest will start to be charged by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, get in touch with your broker. There’s been a lot to take in and they won’t mind you asking as many questions as you need to.  After all, your home is probably the biggest purchase you’re going to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you seek legal advice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask your broker as many questions as you like – there’s no such thing as stupid question&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep to the settlement date in the contract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoy your new home!&lt;/li&gt;

Wrong! Unfortunately it’s a part of everyday life these days. I think using technology to help make decisions is a great thing, but it must be used with common sense and a helpful attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A customer, (let’s call him Bob to protect the innocent), had saved with his bank since he was at school and had been pretty loyal. He chose the bank because his parents had banked there all their lives too. He bought his car with a loan from the bank and paid the money back on time. He took their credit card offer and used it wisely (ish!). In fact, he’d even recommended that his friends used the same bank as it’d been plain sailing for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it happened. The computer said ‘no!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob found his perfect home. He knew he could afford it and he knew his credit score was spot on, so he approached his bank for a home loan. They had a great rate on offer to ‘loyal’ customers so it was a no brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he didn’t realise was that the ‘rules’ had not had common sense applied to them. Him changing companies 11 months before for a job with better pay and better prospects was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep – the bank’s policy was that you must be with your employer for 12 months. When you make your application – not when your loan actually starts. You can’t make this stuff up. It’s worth talking to your broker when you first start thinking about your home loan and he can let you know the potential pitfalls.  He can also be on your side should you need to make the bank use common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgotten how funny (and scarily lifelike) the Little Britain sketch is? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AJQ3TM-p2QI&quot;&gt;Watch it now!&lt;/a&gt; Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">It’s just a line from the Little Britain comedy show, right?

What most people don’t know, though is that in many cases you can affect your own credit score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your credit score is, similar to a sports score, simply how many points you’ve earned based on how you have been managing your finances. Like in sport, the aim of the game is to get the highest number of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banks and credit providers analyse different pieces of information about you to come up with a ‘score’ for you, between 0 and 1,200 points. They will then decide whether they are willing to lend to you, or decide that you’re too risky. They usually expect you to score at least 600 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-affect-your-score&quot;&gt;How can you affect your score?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of different pieces of information that are used. Based on the many home buyers I have helped, the main ones that I have found to influence your score are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shopping-around&quot;&gt;Shopping around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to shop around to get the best deal. But – if you apply for loans and don’t take them out this can be pretty bad for your score. If you applied for 5 different loans over 6 months, just to check out rates and payments, it can knock a massive 300 points off your score! So the best thing to do is research what you want before making any applications – and try to make only one application. A broker can do research on your behalf too which can help you to compare what’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;late-paying-bills&quot;&gt;Late Paying Bills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying your bills on time is really important – even just forgetting for one or two days can reduce your score.  Banks are looking at whether you’re likely to pay them back and paying late, or missing payments altogether indicates that you are less likely to pay them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-maxed-out&quot;&gt;Being Maxed out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How close to your credit limit are you? If there’s not much difference between what you owe and your limit, this can, again, reduce your score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-older&quot;&gt;Getting older&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t change how old you are – but your age is another piece of information that banks look at. The older you are, usually the better credit score you have. This is purely because you’ve got a longer ‘track record’ and if you were going to have financial problems you probably would have had them already! 
So, it can all sound a bit scary but now you know the basics you can understand more about your own credit score. You can find out more. But take care. Getting a copy of your credit report is a great idea – but using ‘Free’ credit report sites can reduce your score. If you’re seriously thinking of applying for a loan, request a report directly from Equifax instead, or just talk to your broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you pay your bills on time – plan or save each month to make sure you have enough money to pay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shop around, or even better, get your broker to do it for you. But don’t apply until you’re sure you’ll take the loan out&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 2 different situations but with the exact same purpose, which is good debt and which is bad debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol needs $10,000 to buy a car to get to her new job but without the car she cannot get to her new job. The job is FT and the pay is very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy needs $10,000 to buy a car to get to his new job but without the car he cannot get to his new job.  The job is part time for a few hours per week and pay is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the current definitions of good and bad debt, both Carol and Jimmy have bad debt, but do they really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to look at good and bad debt on the basis of our ability to repay the debt instead of what the debt is actually for, we begin to have a more realistic and relevant perception of whether the debt we have is good or bad but the one thing that still stands true is bad debt should always be paid off before good debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, we should not feel bad about what we go into debt for, we should only feel bad when we go into debt knowing it is going to be difficult to pay back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">For decades, finance experts have described good debt as a debt to buy an appreciating asset such as a house or shares and bad debt is debt that doesn’t such as credit cards and personal loans for holidays but what if we looked at this argument in a different way.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/uploads/post-redefining-good-vs-bad-debt.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Donate to charity?

&lt;p&gt;The client’s honest intention was simply to make a $10 donation each month to charity however that donation took the form of a $10 endeavour lottery ticket. Unfortunately, the word ‘Lotteries’ appears on his statement. The software identifies the word Lotteries showing up on a regular basis and therefore flagged a potential gambling problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be pleased to know the clients ‘gambling addiction’ was thoroughly explained and eventually ignored but it did create unnecessary delays and anxiety for the client and his broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As banks continue to utilise technology to speed up processing times the human element and common sense is becoming obsolete but get used to it because it’s here to stay. 
So before you apply for your next loan, look over your statements to see what nasty habits you’ve been getting yourself into to, because if you don’t, the bank will!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">A client of mine, who regularly donated to charity for over 20 years, got a rude shock last week when a bank’s statement scanning software identified the client as a potential gambler.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/true" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Important Contract Clauses (Qld)—Finance Date</title><link href="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/important-contract-clauses-finance-date/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Important Contract Clauses (Qld)—Finance Date" /><published>2017-08-11T07:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-08-11T07:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/important-contract-clauses-finance-date</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/important-contract-clauses-finance-date/">&lt;p&gt;In Queensland, the Finance Date Contract Clauses refer to the period of time a buyer has to obtain formal finance approval for the purchase after entering a contract to buy a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-it-exist&quot;&gt;Why does it exist?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give banks and lenders the time they need to formally assess the borrower and that the property is acceptable security for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-does-it-last-for&quot;&gt;How long does it last for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry standard is approaching 21 days (includes weekends and public holidays) but it can be any period of time agreed to by both the buyer and the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-day-does-it-start&quot;&gt;What day does it start?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day the contract is dated regardless of whether this is a business day or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-does-it-end&quot;&gt;When does it end?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 5pm on the day noted in the finance clause. If this is a non-business day, the expiry date carries forward to the next business day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-the-buyer-have-to-do-during-the-finance-period&quot;&gt;What does the buyer have to do during the finance period?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a formal application for a loan with your broker. Need to supply all documents including payslips, statements of savings etc etc. The bank needs to undertake a full assessment of this information and in most cases will also arrange an independent valuer to value the property. Once the bank issues a formal letter of approval, forward this letter immediately to your solicitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-change-my-mind-about-the-contract-during-the-finance-period&quot;&gt;Can I change my mind about the contract during the finance period?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. That is what the cooling off period was for. You must make all reasonable efforts to secure finance on or before finance expiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-my-finance-is-declined&quot;&gt;What if my finance is declined?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send a copy of the decline letter to your solicitor who will advise the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-i-need-more-time&quot;&gt;What if I need more time?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your solicitor know immediately. They can request the seller extend the expiry date to give you more time. The seller can however refuse the request and you could potentially miss out on the property. Never assume finance extensions will be granted and never delay the loan application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-there-a-finance-clause-when-purchasing-at-an-auction&quot;&gt;Is there a finance clause when purchasing at an Auction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. When buying at Auction, it is assumed you have sufficient finances available prior to bidding. In most cases lenders will not be able to provide an unconditional finance approval for a property prior to the purchase because they cannot assess whether that property is acceptable security for a loan until after the Auction. It is highly recommended you speak to your broker prior to bidding at Auction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">In Queensland, the Finance Date Contract Clauses refer to the period of time a buyer has to obtain formal finance approval for the purchase after entering a contract to buy a property.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/true" /></entry></feed>
