Wrong! Unfortunately it’s a part of everyday life these days. I think using technology to help make decisions is a great thing, but it must be used with common sense and a helpful attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a great example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A customer, (let’s call him Bob to protect the innocent), had saved with his bank since he was at school and had been pretty loyal. He chose the bank because his parents had banked there all their lives too. He bought his car with a loan from the bank and paid the money back on time. He took their credit card offer and used it wisely (ish!). In fact, he’d even recommended that his friends used the same bank as it’d been plain sailing for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it happened. The computer said ‘no!’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bob found his perfect home. He knew he could afford it and he knew his credit score was spot on, so he approached his bank for a home loan. They had a great rate on offer to ‘loyal’ customers so it was a no brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he didn’t realise was that the ‘rules’ had not had common sense applied to them. Him changing companies 11 months before for a job with better pay and better prospects was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep – the bank’s policy was that you must be with your employer for 12 months. When you make your application – not when your loan actually starts. You can’t make this stuff up. It’s worth talking to your broker when you first start thinking about your home loan and he can let you know the potential pitfalls.  He can also be on your side should you need to make the bank use common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgotten how funny (and scarily lifelike) the Little Britain sketch is? &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AJQ3TM-p2QI&quot;&gt;Watch it now!&lt;/a&gt; Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">It’s just a line from the Little Britain comedy show, right?

What most people don’t know, though is that in many cases you can affect your own credit score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your credit score is, similar to a sports score, simply how many points you’ve earned based on how you have been managing your finances. Like in sport, the aim of the game is to get the highest number of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banks and credit providers analyse different pieces of information about you to come up with a ‘score’ for you, between 0 and 1,200 points. They will then decide whether they are willing to lend to you, or decide that you’re too risky. They usually expect you to score at least 600 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-you-affect-your-score&quot;&gt;How can you affect your score?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of different pieces of information that are used. Based on the many home buyers I have helped, the main ones that I have found to influence your score are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shopping-around&quot;&gt;Shopping around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s great to shop around to get the best deal. But – if you apply for loans and don’t take them out this can be pretty bad for your score. If you applied for 5 different loans over 6 months, just to check out rates and payments, it can knock a massive 300 points off your score! So the best thing to do is research what you want before making any applications – and try to make only one application. A broker can do research on your behalf too which can help you to compare what’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;late-paying-bills&quot;&gt;Late Paying Bills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying your bills on time is really important – even just forgetting for one or two days can reduce your score.  Banks are looking at whether you’re likely to pay them back and paying late, or missing payments altogether indicates that you are less likely to pay them too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;being-maxed-out&quot;&gt;Being Maxed out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How close to your credit limit are you? If there’s not much difference between what you owe and your limit, this can, again, reduce your score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-older&quot;&gt;Getting older&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t change how old you are – but your age is another piece of information that banks look at. The older you are, usually the better credit score you have. This is purely because you’ve got a longer ‘track record’ and if you were going to have financial problems you probably would have had them already! 
So, it can all sound a bit scary but now you know the basics you can understand more about your own credit score. You can find out more. But take care. Getting a copy of your credit report is a great idea – but using ‘Free’ credit report sites can reduce your score. If you’re seriously thinking of applying for a loan, request a report directly from Equifax instead, or just talk to your broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-points&quot;&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you pay your bills on time – plan or save each month to make sure you have enough money to pay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shop around, or even better, get your broker to do it for you. But don’t apply until you’re sure you’ll take the loan out&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 2 different situations but with the exact same purpose, which is good debt and which is bad debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol needs $10,000 to buy a car to get to her new job but without the car she cannot get to her new job. The job is FT and the pay is very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimmy needs $10,000 to buy a car to get to his new job but without the car he cannot get to his new job.  The job is part time for a few hours per week and pay is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the current definitions of good and bad debt, both Carol and Jimmy have bad debt, but do they really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to look at good and bad debt on the basis of our ability to repay the debt instead of what the debt is actually for, we begin to have a more realistic and relevant perception of whether the debt we have is good or bad but the one thing that still stands true is bad debt should always be paid off before good debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, we should not feel bad about what we go into debt for, we should only feel bad when we go into debt knowing it is going to be difficult to pay back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">For decades, finance experts have described good debt as a debt to buy an appreciating asset such as a house or shares and bad debt is debt that doesn’t such as credit cards and personal loans for holidays but what if we looked at this argument in a different way.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/uploads/post-redefining-good-vs-bad-debt.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Donate to charity?

&lt;p&gt;The client’s honest intention was simply to make a $10 donation each month to charity however that donation took the form of a $10 endeavour lottery ticket. Unfortunately, the word ‘Lotteries’ appears on his statement. The software identifies the word Lotteries showing up on a regular basis and therefore flagged a potential gambling problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be pleased to know the clients ‘gambling addiction’ was thoroughly explained and eventually ignored but it did create unnecessary delays and anxiety for the client and his broker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As banks continue to utilise technology to speed up processing times the human element and common sense is becoming obsolete but get used to it because it’s here to stay. 
So before you apply for your next loan, look over your statements to see what nasty habits you’ve been getting yourself into to, because if you don’t, the bank will!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">A client of mine, who regularly donated to charity for over 20 years, got a rude shock last week when a bank’s statement scanning software identified the client as a potential gambler.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/true" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Important Contract Clauses (Qld)—Finance Date</title><link href="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/important-contract-clauses-finance-date/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Important Contract Clauses (Qld)—Finance Date" /><published>2017-08-11T07:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-08-11T07:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/important-contract-clauses-finance-date</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/important-contract-clauses-finance-date/">&lt;p&gt;In Queensland, the Finance Date Contract Clauses refer to the period of time a buyer has to obtain formal finance approval for the purchase after entering a contract to buy a property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-it-exist&quot;&gt;Why does it exist?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give banks and lenders the time they need to formally assess the borrower and that the property is acceptable security for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-long-does-it-last-for&quot;&gt;How long does it last for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry standard is approaching 21 days (includes weekends and public holidays) but it can be any period of time agreed to by both the buyer and the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-day-does-it-start&quot;&gt;What day does it start?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day the contract is dated regardless of whether this is a business day or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-does-it-end&quot;&gt;When does it end?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 5pm on the day noted in the finance clause. If this is a non-business day, the expiry date carries forward to the next business day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-the-buyer-have-to-do-during-the-finance-period&quot;&gt;What does the buyer have to do during the finance period?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a formal application for a loan with your broker. Need to supply all documents including payslips, statements of savings etc etc. The bank needs to undertake a full assessment of this information and in most cases will also arrange an independent valuer to value the property. Once the bank issues a formal letter of approval, forward this letter immediately to your solicitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-i-change-my-mind-about-the-contract-during-the-finance-period&quot;&gt;Can I change my mind about the contract during the finance period?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. That is what the cooling off period was for. You must make all reasonable efforts to secure finance on or before finance expiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-my-finance-is-declined&quot;&gt;What if my finance is declined?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send a copy of the decline letter to your solicitor who will advise the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-if-i-need-more-time&quot;&gt;What if I need more time?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your solicitor know immediately. They can request the seller extend the expiry date to give you more time. The seller can however refuse the request and you could potentially miss out on the property. Never assume finance extensions will be granted and never delay the loan application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-there-a-finance-clause-when-purchasing-at-an-auction&quot;&gt;Is there a finance clause when purchasing at an Auction?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. When buying at Auction, it is assumed you have sufficient finances available prior to bidding. In most cases lenders will not be able to provide an unconditional finance approval for a property prior to the purchase because they cannot assess whether that property is acceptable security for a loan until after the Auction. It is highly recommended you speak to your broker prior to bidding at Auction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">In Queensland, the Finance Date Contract Clauses refer to the period of time a buyer has to obtain formal finance approval for the purchase after entering a contract to buy a property.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lendfirst.com.au/true" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Can online dating improve your loan application?</title><link href="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/can-online-dating-improve-your-loan-application/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Can online dating improve your loan application?" /><published>2017-07-27T07:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-07-27T07:00:00+10:00</updated><id>https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/Can-online-dating-improve-your-loan-application</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lendfirst.com.au/blog/can-online-dating-improve-your-loan-application/">&lt;p&gt;First Home Buyer but still single?

Now that the Queensland First Home Buyers Grant of $20,000 has been extended until 31st December 2017, I wondered how long it would take to save $20,000 if I stopped buying avocado on toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, 9 years… Assuming I paid $22 for an Avocado smash and I had one twice a week, every week of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be an easier way if you are a First Home Buyer. Some lenders may let you ‘pretend’ the $20,000 grant is your own savings so if your ‘real’ savings is small, buying or building your First Home today might just be possible. The lending criteria is very complex and you should speak to a mortgage broker who specialises in First Home Buyers as the wrong advice could mean the difference between owning your own home or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the main requirements to qualify for the government $20k grant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be buying or building a ‘Brand New’ home under $750,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You or your spouse must not have previously owned property in Australia before&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must live in the house as your primary residence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be 18yrs old&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You must be an Australian Citizen or Permanent Resident (or applying with someone who is)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://firsthomeowners.initiatives.qld.gov.au/&quot;&gt;Queensland First Home Owners Grant&lt;/a&gt; or contact the Qld Office of State Revenue directly on 1300 300 734 to find out if you are eligible before considering or discussing your finance options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>patternworks_</name></author><summary type="html">For those that missed the punchline, an Australian millionaire recently suggested millennials stop buying an Avocado Smash to save for a house deposit and his comments went viral around the globe (read the article here).

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-does-it-end&quot;&gt;When does it end?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5pm on the 5th day&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-the-buyer-waive-the-cooling-off-period&quot;&gt;Can the buyer waive the cooling off period?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-the-seller-waive-the-cooling-off-period&quot;&gt;Can the seller waive the cooling off period?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-exempt-from-a-cooling-off-clause&quot;&gt;What is exempt from a cooling off clause?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contract where the property is purchased at auction or is purchased before 5pm the day after the auction and the buyer was a registered bidder.  Some other exclusions apply however these should be discussed with your legal representative.&lt;/p&gt;
