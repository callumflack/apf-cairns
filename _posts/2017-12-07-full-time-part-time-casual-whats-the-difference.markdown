Any lender will look at what type of employment you have, not just what income you get,
when you apply for a loan. Your employment history gives them an indication of your
likelihood to continue to work, and of course, pay your loan.

Here is a guide to the main types of employment and how lenders look at them when
assessing your loan application.

## Full Time

You work for the same employer ‘full time‘, that is, a minimum of 38 hours each week.

If you are away from work for holidays, or because you’re ill, your employer will still to
pay you.

Lenders like full time employees because your income is consistent and there’s a higher
chance that you will stay in the same job once they have given you the loan.

## Part Time

Part time is pretty much the same as full time, with the only difference being that you
would work fewer than 38 hours each week. Lenders look favourably on part time employees
too.

## Casual

Casual sounds like a more flexible type of employment and it is.

Hours each week may vary and there’s no holiday pay or sick pay. Income is usually higher
as it is ‘loaded’ to cover for the lack of holiday and sick pay.

Lenders are often a bit more cautious with Casual employees as their income can vary from
week to week. If you have been with the same employer for more than 12 months, lenders are
a little more relaxed but will consider the income in a slightly different way.

## Length of time

As well as the type of employment, lenders look to see how long you have been in the same
job or industry.

If you have been in the same industry for 2 years, you usually only need to have been in
the same job for 1 complete pay period for part and full-time employees.

If you have switched industry, or have had time off between jobs then lenders usually
expect you to have been in your job for 12 months.

If you’re casual lenders usually look for you to be in the same job continuously for 12
months
