We would all like to think we have good manners, but when you haven’t done something before it can be confusing to know just what’s expected of you. Take looking at someone else’s home. We know it’s probably not OK to grab a beer from the fridge, but what else should we do? 

* **Give yourself plenty of time.** Arriving at 1:59 when the open home finishes at 2 is not a great start.
* **Make sure you park politely.** Parking in the driveway is a no-no until you own the home.
* **Test the drawers and cupboards—once not ten times.** Don’t go through every drawer and cupboard either.
* **Take your shoes off.** Wear thongs that you can leave on the doorstep. People have probably had the floors cleaned for this inspection.
* **Bring a tape measure.** You’ll need one to check that your furniture, fridge and TV fit in the space you’re seeing.
* **Talk to the agent.** They are likely to remember the courteous people and can help you with this purchase—or notify you of others that come on the market.
* **Finally—go to the loo before you inspect.** Do not, I repeat, do not, use the toilet. I can’t stress this enough!
